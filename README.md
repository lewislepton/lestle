# lestle theme collection
lovely simple and clear theme for - sublime/atom/vscode/xcode

rather than the 'too dark' or even 'too bright' of most color schemes. i have been always after something which can suit both parties.
so rather than switching themes, its easy to stick with one

not too dark, not too bright... just right ;)

enjoy

***SHOW & HIDE***
---
you will have to 'show' hidden files on mac computers to get to the folder. so you can use this to show
```defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -boolean true ; killall Finder```

then use this to hide again
```defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -boolean false ; killall Finder```
