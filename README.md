# Lestle

![screenshot](image/screenshot.png)

***LESTLE*** is a simple & minimal theme for the eyes.

Rather than go for something too dark, or too bright, we have something in the middle. It's just feels right ;)

# Features
• Easy on the eyes colors.  
• Sidebar/Gutter colors<br>
  Green - ***Added***  
  Purple - ***Modified***  
  Red - ***Deleted***  
  Grey - ***Highlighted named item***<br>
• Smooth line number viewing<br>
• Light line viewing markers<br>
• Looks lovely

I plan to have additions to this theme & fix colors when needed/found that I may have missed. Things would change from time to time. But nothing drastic ;)

Enjoy, have phün & happy coding
