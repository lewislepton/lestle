**LESTLE** is a simple & minimal theme for the eyes.

Rather than go for something too dark, or too bright... It's just right ;)

# INSTALL VSCODE
Easy to install. Simply place the `lestle_vscode` folder in your vscode extensions folder - which is located [on mac]
`HD/Users/userName/.vscode/extensions`
Please use the 'show & hide' below

---

# SHOW & HIDE
The easier high sierra+ way<br>
Press:
```
shift + cmd + .
```
To show hidden files<br>
Then press again to hide again<br>
<br>
The old 'pre high sierra way'<br>
You will have to 'show' hidden files on mac computers to get to the folder using terminal. So you can use this to show
```
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -boolean true ; killall Finder
```
Then use this to hide again
```
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -boolean false ; killall Finder
```

# FUTURE

I plan to have additions to this theme & fix colors when needed/found that I may have missed. Things would change from time to time. But nothing drastic ;)
